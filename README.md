This repository was created for the Programming Assignment set in Week 4 of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course. 

## Dataset
[UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Files
* ```run_analysis.R ```- This file includes the code written for the assignment, based on the instructions given. The instructions include
    +reading traing, test, subject and variable data files into R
    +merging data sets together into one data set
    +extracting the mean and standard deviation measurements for each measurement observed
    +using descriptive activity names to names the activities in the data set
    +labelling the data set with descriptive variable names
    +creating a final tidy data set with the average calculated for each variable in each activity
* ```CodeBook.md ```- This file contains a description of the variables, data, and any transformations done to clean up the data set
* ```FinalData.txt ```- This file is the final data set created after following the code written in run_analysis.R
